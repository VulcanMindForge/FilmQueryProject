# FilmQueryProject

# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jacob Stuart
### Programming student with Skill Distillery

- Iâ€™m currently working on [FilmQueryProject](https://github.com/VulcanMindForge/FilmQueryProject)

- Iâ€™m currently learning **Java**

- All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/VulcanMindForge](https://github.com/VulcanMindForge)

# Description of this project
Pull film and actor information from a database hosted locally.

# How to use this project
There will be a loop in which the user will be prompted to decide what type of search criteria you wish to use. Based on the option chosen the user will fill out a prompt and see the requested information. The user will then have the option to get all information pertaining to the film results, or return to main. If multiple films match the criteria, the user will have the option to return to the main menu or continue.

# Technologies Used
Overall I am learning and using Eclipse IDE. Previously I was trying to use as many topics as possible to increase my understanding and retention. Moving forward, I will be trying to keep the topics down to only what seems best for the program.

I will be pulling from the following languages.
- Java 1.8
- MySQL
- Maven

# Current Progress
- Initialized classes
- Set database access methods
- Implement User Interface to deliver and respond to prompts.
- Implement Methods to display results.
- Implement Menus
- Test for Exceptions/Errors

# Next Steps
- implement film category retrieval and display.
- implement inventory retrival and display
- implement search by category or special features


# Lessons learned or reinforced on this project
