# FilmQueryProject

# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jacob Stuart
### Programming student with Skill Distillery

- Iâ€™m currently working on [FilmQueryProject](https://github.com/VulcanMindForge/FilmQueryProject)

- Iâ€™m currently learning **Java**

- All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/VulcanMindForge](https://github.com/VulcanMindForge)

# Description of this project
Pull film and actor information from a database hosted locally.

# How to use this project
There will be a loop in which the user will be prompted to decide what type of search criteria you wish to use. Based on the option chosen the user will fill out a prompt and see the requested information. The user will then have the option to get all information pertaining to the film results, or return to main. At any prompt the user will be able to type quit to exit the program.

# Technologies Used
Overall I am learning and using Eclipse IDE. Previously I was trying to use as many topics as possible to increase my understanding and retention. Moving forward, I will be trying to keep the topics down to only what seems best for the program.

I will be pulling from the following languages.
Java 1.8
MySQL
Maven

# Current Progress
Initialized classes
Set class methods

# Next Steps
Implement User Interface to deliver and respond to prompts.
Implement Methods to display results.
Implement Menus
Test for Exceptions/Errors
Debug

# Lessons learned or reinforced on this project
SELECT statements
PreparedStatements
Encapsulation

# Lessons to research
